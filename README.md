## MPG shinyapp is based on R build-in mtcars dataset. A simple linear regression model is built within the app. 
 
## The histogram generated on the right-hand side shows the distribution of MPG of cars in the dataset. The user inputs via fluidPage on the left-hand side will be passed to the model to predict MPG, which will be displayed under the histogram.
